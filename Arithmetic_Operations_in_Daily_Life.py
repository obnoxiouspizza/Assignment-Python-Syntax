# Question 3 Task 1: Grocery Store Math

# Prices of groceries
bread_price = 4
jelly_price = 3.5
peanut_butter_price = 2.5

# Calculate the total cost of all groceries
total_cost = bread_price + jelly_price + peanut_butter_price

# Print the total cost of all groceries
print("Your total is:", total_cost)

# Question 3 Task 2: Bank Interest

# Initial ammount and interest rate
initial_amount = 10000
interest_rate = 0.07 # 7%

# Calculate interest
interest = initial_amount * interest_rate

# Calculate total amount after one year
total_amount = initial_amount + interest

# Print result after one year
print("The total amount after one year is:", total_amount)
